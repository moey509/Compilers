Compilers PA5 text file

1. We did not discuss the assignment with any other group.

2. Distribution of work: 
   The entire group was responsible for fixing PA4 so that the output would compile and run correctly.
   Jimmy and Toshi were responsible for fixing Memory Management from PA4.
   Ansha was responsible for LSA.
   Matt was responsible for CSE.

3. Additional Comments: 
   We spent a very long time fixing issues from PA4 and as a result we did not have time to complete Primitives. 
   There are many bugs, especially with CSE because when we have a known bug with cloning a CSE context. 
   CSE can be disabled by commenting out line 72 in IrMain.
