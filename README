Notes: 


WHEN ADDING DECREMENT CODE, SET TO NULL

iterable and iterator are not getting freed at the end of for loops
decrement return 
check -> in the main return, we need to increment adn decrement the iterator
check -> for (v in e)
	need to free v if it's special case



-> increment input
-> unrolling (iterable_append(new_git_obj()))
